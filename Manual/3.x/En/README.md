EasySwoole is a distributed, persistent memory PHP framework based on the Swoole extension. It was created specifically for APIs to get rid of the performance penalties associated with process calls and file loading.
EasySwoole highly encapsulates the Swoole Server and still maintains the original features of the Swoole server, supports simultaneous monitoring of HTTP, custom TCP, and UDP protocols, allowing developers to write multi-process, asynchronous, and highly available applications with minimal learning cost and effort.

## Common functions and components
- Http controller and custom routes support
- TCP, UDP, WEB_SOCKET support
- Multiple communication protocols support 
- Coroutine pool support
- Asynchronous processes, custom processes, timers support 
- RPC support
- Crontab Rule Timer support
- Remote Console support
